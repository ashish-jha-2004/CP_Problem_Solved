Introduction
------------

Competitive programming is a sport where coders compete to solve algorithmic problems within a time limit. This repository serves as a collection of solutions I've developed while participating in various contests and practicing on different platforms. It’s a way to track my progress and share my approaches with others who might find them helpful.

Repository Structure

    ├── problem_name.cpp
    └── README.md
    

*   **problem_name.cpp**: file named after the specific problem.


How to Use
----------

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/competitive-programming.git
    
2.  **Navigate to the Problem:**
    
    Go to Google and search for the problem name (problem_name.cpp) you will find it. (generally codeforces or cses problem)
    
3.  **Run the Solution:**
    
    Compile and run the solution on your local machine using a C++ compiler:
    
        
        g++ -o problem_name problem_name.cpp
        ./problem_name

    get your testcases from problem site. (above mentioned in Navigate to the problem section)
                    
    

Contributing
